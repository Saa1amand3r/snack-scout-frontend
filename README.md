# Snack Scout: Your AI-Powered Snack Finder

Snack Scout is a smart mobile app that makes snack shopping faster, cheaper, and more convenient. Using advanced AI, biweekly data updates, and smart decision-making algorithms, Snack Scout helps you find the best deals on your favorite snacks at nearby storesâ€”whether you're craving an energy drink, a sweet treat, or a healthy bite.

## Key Features

### Intelligent Search
- Find snacks by typing or speaking your cravings (e.g., "I want a white Monster, a cookie, and a melon").
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) extracts product details and accurately understands your intent.

### Store and Price Comparison
- Access a biweekly updated database of store prices and locations.
- View a list of stores sorted by total cost and walking distance for the items you need.

### Interactive Prompter
- If you're unsure what you want, Snack Scout asks follow-up questions (e.g., "What flavor of energy drink do you prefer?").
- Provides personalized recommendations based on your preferences.

## How It Works
